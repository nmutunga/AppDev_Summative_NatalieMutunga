# AppDev_Summative

The logical steps followed in this summative are as follows:

app_summative_solar.ipynb - jupyter file containing the Machine learning model on the solar data
app_summative_wind.ipynb - jupyter file containing the Machine Learning model on the wind farm data
weather_data.py - python script that gets weather data from the api
predictions.py - the python scripts uses the weather data obtained to make predictions using the ML model. The second part of the cript allows for recalculation of predicted power after scaling using maintenance data
app.py - python script that runs the flask app and provides endpoints 
text.py - python script that uses Twilio client to send sms
